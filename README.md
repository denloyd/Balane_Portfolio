Here are the tags and elements I used when I was creating my own portfolio using HTML only. 


<!DOCTYPE html>: it defines the document type and version of HTML used. It ensures the browser renders the page in standards mode, using HTML5.
<html lang="en">: The opening tag for the HTML document. The lang="en" attribute specifies the language of the content (English).
<body background="image/pics/bg.jpg">: Defines the main content of the HTML document. Because using CSS is prohibited, I only used old attributes background to set an image as the background of the webpage, so my portfolio is not plain.
<meta charset="UTF-8">: Specifies the character encoding for the HTML document (UTF-8), ensuring proper display of special characters.
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">: This meta tag makes the webpage responsive by controlling the layout on mobile browsers, ensuring proper scaling.
<title>: Defines the title of the webpage, which is displayed in the browser tab.
<font face="Arial">: This tag is also old, but I want to specify the font to be used for this website.
<header>: Contains introductory content for the webpage, including logos and navigation links. It is typically used for introductory or navigational information.
<table>: Creates a table to organize content. The attributes width, border, cellpadding, and cell spacing adjust the table's layout.
<tr>, <td>, <th>: These are table row (<tr>), table data (<td>), and table header (<th>) tags. They define the structure of rows and columns within the table.
<img>: use to import an image on the website. It includes the src attribute to define the image source, alt for alternate text, and width/height to set image size.
<nav>: This element defines a set of navigation links, such as for a menu.
<a href="URL">: Creates a hyperlink. The href attribute defines the destination URL, and the text between the tags is the clickable link.
<hr>: This creates a horizontal rule or line
<h1>: Defines the highest level of heading, I used it for titles or section headers. 
<br>: It is a break line. I used it to produce a line break in text.
<p align="center">: stands a paragraph of text. The align="center" attribute centers the text within the paragraph.
<section>: This element defines thematic sections of content, like “Projects” or “Skills.” It helps organize the content of the page.
<form>: Represents a form that users can fill out and submit
<input type="text">: Creates a text input field.
<input type="email">: Creates an input field for email addresses.
<textarea>: Creates a multiline text input field.
<input type="submit">: Creates a button to submit the form data.
<footer>: Defines the footer of the page, typically containing copyright information or additional links.
<center>: Centers the content inside the tag. This tag is also old.
target="_blank": This attribute, when you click the link, it opens the linked page in a new browser tab.

Because css is prohibited I used old tags and attributes so i can arrange the text website properply.
